### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--

This is really a simple attempt to host my sitemapes on github. I know, everyone says it has to be on your site but.... others seem to be providing a service. So, let's see where this takes us.
If you have a suggestion or alternative plan, feel free to let me know.
I have tried to protect myself from anyone trying to mess with my site...I just ask.. please don't.
If you see something that can help you...it's yours..you know C\C\P
I'll start off with basic site maps:
sitemap.txt
sitemap.xml
sitemap_image.xml
sitemap_index.xml

Goal is to also add a video sitemap and see if meta tags can help too.

Yes, I know that google and everyone else screams that no one looks at it. But have you noticed that on any report, you get docked for it?? They say, it may not affect the outcome, but it does. Would like a few thoughts on that...when you have time.

So, once again, this is just a simple exercise. If you have a thought or words of advice, they are always welcome. Feel free to reach out to me as well:
