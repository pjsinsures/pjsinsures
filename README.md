# pjsinsures-Sitemap setup 
Currently have a new Google site set up on google hosted. 


# Hi, I'm Peter ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About This little project
This is really a simple attempt to host my sitemaps on github. I know, everyone says it has to be on your site but.... others seem to be providing a remote service (like PRO-sitemaps.com). So, let's see where this takes us.
If you have a suggestion or alternative plan, feel free to let me know.



## Goal is to also add a video sitemap and see if meta tags can help too.
Yes, I know that google and everyone else screams that no one looks at it. But have you noticed that on any report, you get docked for it?? They say, it may not affect the outcome, but it does. Would like a few thoughts on that...when you have time.
So, once again, this is just a simple exercise. If you have a thought or words of advice, they are always welcome. Feel free to reach out to me as well:
