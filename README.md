# pjsinsures-Sitemap setup 
Currently have a new Google site set up on google hosted. 
8/17/25 update:
Now hosting on Hostinger and using their web builder tool.


# Hi, I'm Peter 👋


## 🚀 About This little project
This is really a simple attempt to host my sitemaps on github. I know, everyone says it has to be on your site but.... others seem to be providing a remote service (like PRO-sitemaps.com). So, let's see where this takes us.
If you have a suggestion or alternative plan, feel free to let me know.
***Recent updates for this little project 8/5-8/7***
I have, since starting this for sitemaps, also added an images folder. About 12 of the main images for the _images sitemap. Of that, 6 also point to the _video sitemap. I also added 3 images such as a main banner on most of my pages and 2 other larger images that appear on 2-3 pages.
I don't think this will cause a lot of bandwidth, savemorewith.pjsinsures.com is lower in traffic (about 100 hits per day for the last 2 months). Was hoping that using this as a pseudo CDN it may help my page speed a little. Also, went through and pointed all of these images on the website to here on github.

***Update 8/18/25...priorities change but still have a need.***
So... going through everything and now moving adding Hubspot as my CRM and additional Blog site. Completed 6 certifications and wrapping up a few more.
Working on developing and learning a tech stack to boost and grow the insurance side. So far this is what is in the process of getting set up in addition to G work place & Hubspot:
> ClickUp-for project management, page creation and ai tools

> Buffer-for the 3 free soc media accts to create and schedule

> Metricool-for the 5 smaller soc media accts to create and schedule

> Canva-been using the free version for years and will continue for graphic/video creation

> Also starting with the Google developer program to get more into understanding and working with ai

Hope to use this repo now for the content creation side and any work being done with the dev program. I saw in your mktplace there is a code review agent...probably would be using??
Any feedback helpful...Thanks



## Goal is to also add a video sitemap and see if meta tags can help too.
Yes, I know that google and everyone else screams that no one looks at it. But have you noticed that on any report, you get docked for it?? They say, it may not affect the outcome, but it does.
***8/5-8/7 update***
Kinda scrapping the meta tag effort...may take it back up in the future.
Now after adding an images folder and hosting the main ones here...let's see if that helps page speed.
Would like a few thoughts on that...when you have time.
So, once again, this is just a simple exercise. If you have a thought or words of advice, they are always welcome. Feel free to reach out to me as well:
